### Installation

Install the extension in CloudStream. The extension should then download the internal compat APK automatically. Once the installation is complete your Aniyomi extensions should appear in CloudStream.

Installing this plugin does __not__ automatically download all Aniyomi extensions, you still need to get those from Aniyomi.

### Troubleshooting

**No Aniyomi extensions appear**

1. Go to plugin settings _(Settings -> Extensions -> Aniyomi Compat -> Click the extension settings button next to the trashcan)_
2. Check that the compat apk is installed correctly by checking what it says under the **Currently Using:** tab. It should show some long path to an APK file. If it says none click **Force download APK**.
3. If step 2 does not work, grab the APK and install it yourself [here](https://github.com/CranberrySoup/AniyomiCompat/raw/builds/app-debug.apk)
4. Make sure that you actually have Aniyomi Extensions installed. It should show something other than 0 after **Number of extensions**

**Aniyomi extensions do not work**

1. Make sure the extension is function in Aniyomi.
2. Try downloading the compat APK instead of using it internally. Download [here](https://github.com/CranberrySoup/AniyomiCompat/raw/builds/app-debug.apk) or click Install APK externally in plugin settings.
3. Restart CloudStream
4. Make an issue here if it still does not work
